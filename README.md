# Pegasus_ML_Project

I am currently working as an ML/AI Undergraduate intern at the [Pegasus Research Group](https://pegasus.ep.wisc.edu/).  
My fellow researcher and I have initiated a project to analyze audio data using deep learning techniques. 
Our goal is to detect anomalies in sounds generated by devices such as pumps and power supplies. 
This project aims to develop a robust system for identifying irregularities that may indicate mechanical issues or failures, ensuring the reliability of these critical components.
