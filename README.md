# Pegasus_ML_Project

I am currently working as an ML/AI Undergraduate intern at [the Pegasus Research Group](https://pegasus.ep.wisc.edu/). 
The Pegasus-III Experiment, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, focuses on advancing Fusion Energy and Plasma Science.

## Projects Overview

### Pegasus-III GUI (24/5 ~ 24/7)
Designed and developed a PyQt5-based GUI that imports experimental electromagnetic data from internal servers, enabling researchers to efficiently visualize and interact with the data. 

### Pegasus-III Helix Fitting Project (24/7 ~ 24/8)
During this period, we focused on developing and refining code for simulating and fitting helices to the magnetic field data collected from the Pegasus-III experiment. 
###### Helix Simulation and Fitting:
Developed a Python-based simulation model (bdots_helix_fitting.py) that generates 3D helices, simulates their magnetic field values (BzDot), and fits these helices to experimental data.



### Pegasus-III Audio Detection Project (24/9 ~ present)
My fellow researcher and I are working on a project to analyze audio data using deep learning techniques. 
Our goal is to detect anomalies in sounds generated by devices such as pumps and power supplies.

This project aims to develop a robust system for identifying irregularities that may indicate mechanical issues or failures, ensuring the reliability of these critical components. The system leverages advanced neural networks to recognize abnormal sound patterns, enabling early fault detection and preventive maintenance.
